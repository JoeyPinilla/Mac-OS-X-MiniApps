Hello,

this is a Repository of small and lightweight MiniApps for Mac OS X.
Mostly, these are small Shellscripts that should be wrapped as an Application, using Applescript Editor.


1. Open /Applications/Utilities/Applescript Editor
2. Paste the Code
3. Test and save as Application
4. Maybe add an Icon
