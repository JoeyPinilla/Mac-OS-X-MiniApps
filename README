Hello,

This is a Repository of small and lightweight MiniApps for Mac OS X.
Mostly, these are small Shellscripts that should be wrapped as an Application, using AppleScript Editor.


  1. Open /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor
  2. Paste the Code
  3. Test and save as Application
  4. Maybe add an Icon
